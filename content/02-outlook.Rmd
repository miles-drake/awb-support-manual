# Outlook Mailbox

Outlook is not dedicated helpdesk software. The following advice is intended to help make the Analytical Workbench shared mailbox more manageable for everyone who works with it.

## Rules of Thumb

- Every email (or "ticket") should be assigned to someone on the Analytical Workbench team (or "agent"). See "Categorisation", below.
- Tickets that require responses should have a "🚩 to do" flag placed.
- Tickets with a "🚩 to do" flag should be marked as "✔️ complete" when responded to.
- Tickets that do not require a response should not have a 🚩 flag or ✔️ check mark placed.
- Tickets that are complete and over two weeks old should be moved to the "Inbox > Done" folder. See "Quick actions", below.

### Why do all of this organisation?

Archiving and sorting into sub-folders improves the response time and search speed of the Microsoft Exchange server.

Categorisation and flagging makes it easier to search for specific responses or conversations.
