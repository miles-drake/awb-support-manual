It contains: The agreed workflow for agents responding to enquiries; Standard responses for common enquiries; Advice on managing the shared Outlook account. This document has been produced as a website for faster navigation, and quicker referencing. It hopefully encourages better work practices than navigating a massive PDF file. Though this document does not contain any sensitive information, it should not be shared with anyone outside of the Analytical Workbench team. This is a living document, and is in active development. It currently only exists as a very rough skeleton, missing a lot of key details, and will be fleshed out over time. "],["flowchart.html", "Section 2 Flowchart", " Section 2 Flowchart Use the following simple decision tree to decide whether you should assign the message to yourself, and respond. Does the ticket come from a government employee? It may instead have come from a third-party, quango, arms-reach organisation, or similar. If the message has not come from a government employee, forward the message to Gyda. If in doubt forward the message to Michael. Does the ticket pertain to one of the following? If it does not, forward the message to Michael. Help with software on the Workbench; Help with or information on the Workbench technologies (Guacamole, the VMs, etc); Requests for the user guide; A standard request, such as: New user accounts, or Existing account help. Check for an established solution in the appropriate products documentation. For the standard Workbench, check the project Wiki. For the Confidential Workbench, check the user guide on eRDM. Is there no established solution? Investigate and solve the ticket, to the best of your ability. Miless note: Often, a users technical support enquiry can be solved  either entirely or partially  by searching Stack Overflow. Thats the terrible secret of running a helpdesk. If the ticket must be escalated, then escalate it according to the agreed process for that product. "],["outlook-mailbox.html", "Section 3 Outlook Mailbox 3.1 Rules of Thumb 3.2 Categorisation 3.3 Quick Actions", " Section 3 Outlook Mailbox Outlook is not dedicated helpdesk software. The following advice is intended to help make the Analytical Workbench shared mailbox more manageable for everyone who works with it. 3.1 Rules of Thumb Every email (or ticket) should be assigned to someone on the Analytical Workbench team (or agent). See Categorisation, below. Tickets that require responses should have a  to do flag placed. Tickets with a  to do flag should be marked as  complete when responded to. Tickets that do not require a response should not have a  flag or  check mark placed. Tickets that are complete and over two weeks old should be moved to the Inbox &gt; Done folder. See Quick actions, below. 3.1.1 Why do all of this organisation? Archiving and sorting into sub-folders improves the response time and search speed of the Microsoft Exchange server. Categorisation and flagging makes it easier to search for specific responses or conversations. 3.2 Categorisation To do. 3.3 Quick Actions To do. "],["standard-workbench.html", "Section 4 Standard Workbench 4.1 Resources 4.2 Contact 4.3 Escalating with Freshdesk 4.4 Standard Requests", " Section 4 Standard Workbench 4.1 Resources Project Wiki hosted on the University of Edinburghs Atlassian wiki. 4.2 Contact Our point of contact for the standard Workbench (and Serv-U) is the SPACe support desk. Contact them by email at space-support@epcc.ed.ac.uk. 4.3 Escalating with Freshdesk Where possible, when communicating with the SPACe support desk, you should do so through Freshdesk. Send an email to our Freshdesk account at support@analyticalworkbench.freshdesk.com ; This will automatically create an appropriate ticket; Open the ticket, then click Forward; In the To: field, enter space-support@epcc.ed.ac.uk ; Click the horizontal hamburger () to expand the ticket; Trim the contents of the ticket, ensuring that only relevant information is available. SPACe has advised that they do not want to be sent large or irrelevant tickets. Please be aware that SPACe can not view our Freshdesk portal, so all information relevant to the ticket should be included in the forwarded message. 4.4 Standard Requests The following forms can also be found in the Outlook mailbox, under the folder Forms &gt; Standard. SPACe has requested that we send these forms as plain text, rather than tables, and they are presented as such. 4.4.1 New User Accounts To set up a new user account, use the following template: Name: Email: VM: awb-general01 Project reference: awb01 Start date: End date: NA User type: Standard user Agreed timeframe: 3 working days. Project reference is be the name of the shared workspace that the individual has access to. awb01 is the name of the generic project reference, for any user who is not part of a team or does not need a shared workspace. If it is unclear whether the user needs a shared workspace, use awb01 as the project reference. At time of writing, users can not be attached to more than one project reference. If a user needs to work on multiple projects, with multiple shared workspaces, they will need more than one account. Changing a users project reference requires deleting (or abandoning) their old account, and making a new one. End date is used to specify if an account should be automatically deleted on a certain date. Unless this is strictly needed, leave it blank or explicitly not required, such as by entering NA, or similar. User type is used to request users with non-standard permissions. For example, users with root access. With the exception of Analytical Workbench and SPACe staff, this should always be Standard user. 4.4.2 New Project Before users can be created under a project (shared workspace), that project must first exist. Before requesting that new users are created for a project that you are uncertain about the existence of, first confirm that the project exists. At present, we do not have a log of the existing projects. To confirm that a project exists: Log in to your account on the Analytical Workbench; Check the folder of project names /md3_01/. If the requested project name does not exist, then Request that a new project is created. To set up a new project (shared workspace) on the Analytical Workbench, use the following template: Project name: VM which needs access to the project: awb-general01 4.4.3 Password Reset To request that a users passwords are reset, use the following template: Username: Guacamole / VM / Both: Both Agreed timeframe: 24 hours. SPACe helpdesk will email the user to inform them that their passwords have been reset. 4.4.4 Restore Files or Folders To request that a users files or folders are restored from a backup, use the following template: File path: Date of backup: Backups of the /data/ mount are done nightly. The date of backup can be up to two weeks prior to the request being carried out. The file path should be given as the absolute path to the file or directory, as given in File Explorer. For example: /beegfs10/absolute_path/my_folder/. "],["freshdesk.html", "Section 5 Freshdesk 5.1 Logging in to Freshdesk", " Section 5 Freshdesk 5.1 Logging in to Freshdesk To log into our Freshdesk portal as an agent, click the Are you an agent? Login here. button. On some browsers, using the standard login dialogue prevents you from being successfully forwarded to the agent interface. "],["confidential-workbench.html", "Section 6 Confidential Workbench 6.1 Point of Contact 6.2 Standard Requests 6.3 Important 6.4 Download or Upload Data", " Section 6 Confidential Workbench 6.1 Point of Contact Our point of Confidential Workbench is the eDRIS National Safe Haven support desk. Contact them by email at phs.nshtech@phs.scot. Unlike the standard Workbench, there is no complex escalation procedure for tickets forwarded to eDRIS. Do not use the Freshdesk service for tickets related to the Confidential Workbench. 6.2 Standard Requests Standard requests for the Confidential Workbench can be found in the Analytical Workbench Support mailbox, under Forms &gt; Confidential. All relevant information is kept in the messages available in that folder. Because of the nature of the support processes, this document is  for the time being  just a pointer to examine that email folder. You are advised to bookmark the URLs given in these form messages for easier access. 6.3 Important Do not forward the contents of the Add or remove user form message to anyone. 6.4 Download or Upload Data Agreed timeframe: 24 hours. If a user has requested a data upload or download, and enquires about it, please advise that we have an expected 24 hour turnaround time in both directions. If the user has waited more than 24 hours, escalate the ticket. 6.4.1 Escalating Data Download / Upload Requests Escalate as normal. Before sending the email In the email title field, add descriptors to make it clear that it is related to the Confidential Workbench, and a priority matter. Example: \\[SG Confidential WB\\] \\[High Priority\\] Email Title Tag the email as a high priority item. On the Quick Access Toolbar, under the Tags section, click High Importance. Send. "]]
